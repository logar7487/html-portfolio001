<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, my name is AMAD. I currently working the night-shift as a stacker at
  Walmart Supercenter #5672, located at 2662 W Lucas Rd, Lucas, TX 75002.
</p>

<p>
  I take pride in being part of a hardworking team that keeps the store stocked
  and organized for customers. Working overnight requires discipline, focus, and
  a strong work ethic — qualities I’ve developed and continue to sharpen every
  day.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not at work, I enjoy spending time learning new things, staying
  active, and connecting with people from all walks of life. I believe that
  every experience contributes to personal growth, and I’m always looking for
  ways to improve and challenge myself.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd like to connect or have any questions, feel free to reach out to
  Walmart Supercenter #5672 at 469-675-8801.
